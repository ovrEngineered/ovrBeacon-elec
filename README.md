This project contains an open-source implementation of a Bluetooth Low Energy sensor beacon.
The beacon has the following features:
 - Integrated temperature sensor
 - Integrated light sensor
 - Integrated accelerometer
 - Remotely controlled LEDs
 - Wireless charging via Qi standard
 
Note: this repository contains the schematics and PCB design. The firmware repository is located [here](https://github.com/ovrEngineered/ovrBeacon-fw).
